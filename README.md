## Acrylics face Shield for COVID- 19 - Assembly Instructions

**Disclaimer:**

These laser cut shields are made out of Acrylics for the frame, and a transparent sheet for the shields.

These shields are not medical masks and, if used alone, offer only a minimal physical barrier. We make no

As with all health decisions, please consult with your trusted medical professional to determine compatibility
with your personal situation if you are seeking a face shield to wear in relation to medical issues. These face
shields do not come with filters or the option to insert filters.

These shields are **not** assembled in a sterile environment; however all possible precautions are taken to
prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing and limited any person to person contact outside of
our immediate household. Gloves are worn during assembly, however cleaning of shields prior to any use is
always recommended as an extra precaution.
